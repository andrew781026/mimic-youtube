Adrift and powerless, your crippled vessel is bleeding oxygen. As you effect repairs, every breath you take brings you one step closer to death. You must work together to restore power before the air runs out — but hidden among you, as loyal friends and crew members, are imposters who have infiltrated security and continue to sabotage the ship. Their only goal is to avoid detection and kill the crew, by force or by asphyxiation. Can you identify them in time and eliminate the threat? Or will succumb to the menace among us?\n\nThe Menace Among Us is a 40 to 60-minute, asymmetrical card game for 4-8 players. Each player chooses an Agenda at random, either a loyal Crew member, a deadly Menace or the Coward, who’ll take any side just to survive. Your Agenda card sets a Team Goal and an Individual Goal, as well as outlines any special abilities and the card composition of your individual 13-card deck. Then, knowing your Agenda and Goals, you choose a Character who you believe will best help you achieve them or mask your true identity. Characters add 7 new cards to your deck, shuffle-building a unique combination of cards, as well as provide you two specialized Above Deck Actions.\n\nIn this hidden traitor game, how you play your cards and abilities is far more important than the meta game aspects of accusations and denials. Cards are played face down and shuffled together as “Below Deck Actions.” Here, Menace players secretly sabotage the ship’s systems and attack crew members, who are trying to save the ship with their cards. If too few crew members risk going below deck to effect repairs, the ship’s Emergency Maintenance Assistant (EmMA) adds cards to the pile to help. However, the system has also been compromised and occasionally places damaging cards into the mix, providing plausible deniability to the Menace players. In contrast, Above Deck Actions are conducted in full view of the crew. Most of these abilities have costs, either in Energy or Oxygen, both resources the crew is trying to increase. So, while The Doctor has the ability to heal a crew member and remove a debilitating effect, a Menace player, who may be secretly in control of The Doctor, cares far more that it costs 2 Oxygen to perform the healing.\n\nAt some point, someone’s behavior will raise suspicion. But, did they do so because they are trying to fulfill an Individual Goal – or are they a Menace? You can call a vote to expose their true nature. But if they are a loyal Crew member, you’ve just blown precious Oxygen in the effort to detain them. For that matter, was it a Menace player calling the vote in hopes of wasting the air on purpose?\n\nIf the Crew can find and eliminate the Menace players – and raise the Energy to a safe threshold before the air runs out, they win. If the Menace can prevent this or kill the crew outright, their mission succeeds. Special commendations are awarded for surviving and for achieving your Individual Goal.\n\n\n娛樂百分百\n凹鳴狼人殺",

    "description": "遊戲購買連結: https://www.ruten.com.tw/item/show?22042658513851\n\n歡迎再度來到桌遊秀!這次要來玩的是Among Us太空狼人殺的桌遊版 The Menace Among Us!\n我們究竟能不能在達成目標的情況下存活呢? 快來看看吧!\n\n\nAmong Us》是一款多人電子遊戲，由美國]遊戲工作室InnerSloth開發並於2018年6月15日發布。遊戲以太空為主題，玩家將扮演船員（Crewmate）或入侵者（Impostor）之一。船員的目標找出入侵者並完成任務，而入侵者的目標是殺死所有船員而不被發現。雖然遊戲於2018年發布，但鮮有問津，直到2020年因為眾多Twitch實況主和YouTuber遊玩才流行起來。為回應遊戲的熱度，遊戲開發者於2020年8月宣布將開發續作《Among Us 2》，但是一個月後（9月）宣布取消續作的開發，將重點轉移到改進原版遊戲上\nThe Menace Among Us is a semi-cooperative game of intrigue and survival in deep space. Adrift and powerless, your crippled vessel is bleeding oxygen. As you effect repairs, every breath you take brings you one step closer to death. You must work together to restore power before the air runs out — but hidden among you, as loyal friends and crew members, are imposters who have infiltrated security and continue to sabotage the ship. Their only goal is to avoid detection and kill the crew, by force or by asphyxiation. Can you identify them in time and eliminate the threat? Or will succumb to the menace among us?\n\nThe Menace Among Us is a 40 to 60-minute, asymmetrical card game for 4-8 players. Each player chooses an Agenda at random, either a loyal Crew member, a deadly Menace or the Coward, who’ll take any side just to survive. Your Agenda card sets a Team Goal and an Individual Goal, as well as outlines any special abilities and the card composition of your individual 13-card deck. Then, knowing your Agenda and Goals, you choose a Character who you believe will best help you achieve them or mask your true identity. Characters add 7 new cards to your deck, shuffle-building a unique combination of cards, as well as provide you two specialized Above Deck Actions.\n\nIn this hidden traitor game, how you play your cards and abilities is far more important than the meta game aspects of accusations and denials. Cards are played face down and shuffled together as “Below Deck Actions.” Here, Menace players secretly sabotage the ship’s systems and attack crew members, who are trying to save the ship with their cards. If too few crew members risk going below deck to effect repairs, the ship’s Emergency Maintenance Assistant (EmMA) adds cards to the pile to help. However, the system has also been compromised and occasionally places damaging cards into the mix, providing plausible deniability to the Menace players. In contrast, Above Deck Actions are conducted in full view of the crew. Most of these abilities have costs, either in Energy or Oxygen, both resources the crew is trying to increase. So, while The Doctor has the ability to heal a crew member and remove a debilitating effect, a Menace player, who may be secretly in control of The Doctor, cares far more that it costs 2 Oxygen to perform the healing.\n\nAt some point, someone’s behavior will raise suspicion. But, did they do so because they are trying to fulfill an Individual Goal – or are they a Menace? You can call a vote to expose their true nature. But if they are a loyal Crew member, you’ve just blown precious Oxygen in the effort to detain them. For that matter, was it a Menace player calling the vote in hopes of wasting the air on purpose?\n\nIf the Crew can find and eliminate the Menace players – and raise the Energy to a safe threshold before the air runs out, they win. If the Menace can prevent this or kill the crew outright, their mission succeeds. Special commendations are awarded for surviving and for achieving your Individual Goal.\n\n\n娛樂百分百\n凹鳴狼人殺",

        "description": "The International Monetary Fund has forecasted GDP growth of 3.8 percent this year in Taiwan. The prediction, in the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook report, pegs Taiwan’s growth as the highest among the four little dragon economies in Asia. With the spring computer show about to get underway, construction workers rush to finish last-minute preparations.The success of Taiwan’s technology industry is leading to a rosy outlook for Taiwan’s economy.The IMF forecasts that GDP growth will reach 3.8 percent this year and 4.1 percent the following year, beating South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong.Chiu Chun-jung National Central University Last year, among the four dragon economies, Taiwan had the best export performance. The real reason is that demand for the iPhone 6 has yet to subside. More orders keep leading to more production. South Korea and China have developed their own vertical supply chain, so, for example, when Samsung’s growth is poor, the whole Korean economy is affected. (Comparatively) Taiwan hasn’t developed (a reliance) on its own brands. The economy is simply driven by orders. When the US economy is good, Taiwan reaps the benefits.Experts warn that after the rush of export orders subsides, Taiwan’s growth may slow.",

        "description": "Objects have memories. The more they are worn or broken, the more stories they remember. For three days, the energy of the poem led me to the the ruins in small villages as I carefully carried the wreckage of its words.\n\n~\n\nTranslucence has issues with clarity. The eye exerts to see clearly as clarity is definable. The comfort lies in the definition, in the endeavour to identify. A translucent facade or a trans-imagery allows a certain amount of light, but clarity was never the goal. The image then, becomes an essence of exactitude. A remnant of a definition.\n\n\nKuala Lumpur Experimental Film, Video & Music Festival (KLEX) is an artists and volun-teer-run, grassroots international festival of experimental cinema and music. Now in its 9th edition, KLEX 2018, takes place from November 22-25 with the theme of Translu-cence. The festival includes KLEX Open Programs, International Guest Programs, Artist Talks, and Music Performances. This year, the festival’s events will take place at RAW Art Space, Checkmate Creative and Live Fact, all run independently by artists and art enthusiasts. The festival is made possible with the gracious support from Goethe-Institut Malaysia, for its eighth consecutive year.\n\nKLEX OPEN PROGRAMMES:\nKLEX 2018 has received over 185 submissions via its open call, from Malaysia and around the world, including Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Macao, Portugal, Spain, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA, and Vi-etnam. The curatorial committee has selected 31 experimental shorts from the wide range of open call submissions to create three KLEX Open Programmes. A mini video installation work by Thai media artist, Wuttin Chansataboot entitled The Alchemy #01: A Yellow El-lipse in a Red Square will also be presented at the festival. This work explores how digital media and means of mass communication could possibly form a new perception of reality.\n\n INTERNATIONAL GUEST PROGRAMMES:\nGERMANY, SINGAPORE AND THE PHILIPPINES\nKLEX 2018 will showcase three guest programmes from Germany, Singapore, and the Phil-ippines. KLEX is honoured to present the Short Export German short film programme – a collective project by Goethe-Institut Lyon, Kurzfilmfestival Clermont-Ferrand, AG Kurzfilm – Bundesverband Deutscher Kurzfilm, German Films, and KurzFilmAgentur Hamburg. Veter-an film programmer of Singapore International Film Festival, Low Zu Boon, has been invit-ed to present a Singaporean shorts programme. We will also feature a Filippino shorts pro-gramme curated by Franchesca Casauay, co-founder of Manila-based female-curated media art platform, HERESY. Low and Casauay will present their programmes in-person.\n\n MUSIC PERFORMANCES:\nThis year, we have an amazing line-up of 37 local and international musicians and per-formers, including legendary Japanese psychedelic rock band Acid Mother Temple, impro-visers Nicola Hein (Germany), Dirk Stromberg (US), Game of Patience (Malay-sia/Australia/USA), Ali Fyffe (Australia), Arma-Agharta (Lithuania), Paolo Gàiba Riva (Ita-ly), Ida Toninato (Canada), Viola Yip (Hong Kong), Joee & I (Philippines), Rodrigo Parejo (Spain), Max Riefer (Germany/Malaysia); Cheryl Ong, Dharma and Yuen Chee Wai (Singa-pore); Bei San Q Nan, Dino, Hsueh Yung-Chih, Jared Xu and Liu Fangyi (Taiwan); and our very own Bohr, Goh Yen-Lin, Kok Siew-Wai, Mampos, Ping Wei, Tsa Meera, Yii Kah Hoe and Yong Yandsen.\n\nARTISTS’ TALKS:\nThai media artist, Wuttin Chansataboot will give an artist’s talk on his art practice, merg-ing art and technology, alongside co-founders of HERESY, Franchesca Casauay and Joee Mejias where the duo will share their inspirations and experiences of running HERESY, the female-curated media art platform in Manila.\n\nCheck the full festival schedule here:\nhttp://www.klexfilmfest.com/2018/10/f...\n\n~\n\nPlease visit our online platform for more details:\n\nWEBSITE: klexfilmfest.com/\nFACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/groups/klexfest/\nEMAIL: info@klexfilmfest.com",

    "description": "Objects have memories. The more they are worn or broken, the more stories they remember. For three days, the energy of the poem led me to the the ruins in small villages as I carefully carried the wreckage of its words.\n\n~\n\nTranslucence has issues with clarity. The eye exerts to see clearly as clarity is definable. The comfort lies in the definition, in the endeavour to identify. A translucent facade or a trans-imagery allows a certain amount of light, but clarity was never the goal. The image then, becomes an essence of exactitude. A remnant of a definition.\n\n\nKuala Lumpur Experimental Film, Video & Music Festival (KLEX) is an artists and volun-teer-run, grassroots international festival of experimental cinema and music. Now in its 9th edition, KLEX 2018, takes place from November 22-25 with the theme of Translu-cence. The festival includes KLEX Open Programs, International Guest Programs, Artist Talks, and Music Performances. This year, the festival’s events will take place at RAW Art Space, Checkmate Creative and Live Fact, all run independently by artists and art enthusiasts. The festival is made possible with the gracious support from Goethe-Institut Malaysia, for its eighth consecutive year.\n\nKLEX OPEN PROGRAMMES:\nKLEX 2018 has received over 185 submissions via its open call, from Malaysia and around the world, including Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Macao, Portugal, Spain, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA, and Vi-etnam. The curatorial committee has selected 31 experimental shorts from the wide range of open call submissions to create three KLEX Open Programmes.

        "description": "Phycocyanin is a phycobiliprotein that is purified from edible spirulina by water extraction and membrane separation technology. It is the most unique active substance in the nutritional components of spirulina. Blue is pure and clear. At present, C-phycocyanin, a mixture of phycoerythrin and isophycocyanin, is mainly extracted, and other small amounts of proteins and carbohydrates naturally occurring in spirulina.\n\nWhen used as a pigment, the specifications are differentiated according to color price: At present, the conventional specification is 180 color value (the color value is converted to absorbance at 618nm by UV detection under the prescribed dilution factor). Generally adding trehalose as a carrier can increase the stability of the product. You can also customize lower, higher color price or pure powder, and the customer chooses the carrier for compounding.\n\nWhen used as a nutritional supplement, some customers differentiate the specifications according to the phycocyanin content: At present, they are customized according to the content specified by the customer.\n\nBoth the color value and content represent the content of phycocyanin in the final product, and the higher the color value, the higher the content. The 180-color product corresponds to a phycocyanin content of 25% -30%.\n\nUsed as a food additive in China. It has not yet been listed in the food or new food ingredient catalog. The \"Sanitary Standards for the Use of Food Additives\" (GB2760-2014) stipulates that it can be used in candy, jelly, popsicles, ice cream, ice cream, cheese products, fruit juice (flavor) beverages, and the maximum use amount is 0.8g / kg.\n \nPhycocyanin passed GRAS in the United States in 2012 and can be used as a food ingredient in all foods and dietary supplements (except baby food). As an ingredient in all foods except infant formulas and foods under USDA ‘s jurisdiction at levels up to a maximum of 250 milligrams per serving. As a Spirulina Extract, it can be used in confectionery, frosting, ice cream, frozen pastry, pastry coating and decoration, solid beverage, yogurt, sand There is no limit on the number of ingredients such as bread, pudding, cheese, gel candies, bread, ready-to-eat cereals, and dietary supplements (tablets, capsules).\n\nAs a single substance, it is not included in the food additive list (no E-number). However, the European Union has a standard to determine whether an extract can be used as a food ingredient equivalent to its source of extraction, that is, as foods with colorful property (colored food) or colorant (pigment). Phycocyanin meets this standard and can be used as a food ingredient as a spirulina extract or concentrate.",

        "description": "The first International Frisbee Tournament was held in Eagle Harbor, Michigan, in 1958. The sport grew from a pastime of the Healy family picnic and, in the 1960s, its national profile was increased by Jim Boggio Sr.\n\nAs guts evolved during the 1960s, players started throwing faster and faster, until it wasn't unusual to see presumably unbreakable discs traveling at 60--70 mph shatter on impact with an unlucky defender's hand. Catching a speeding disc directly was said to really \"take guts\", thus the name of the game. One tournament player even required fifteen stitches to close a gaping wound across the palm of his hand.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the game had spread across the United States and to other countries, with coverage on radio, television, major newspapers, and magazines such as Time.\n\nWith over 60 teams at a tournament in the heyday of the game, matches became intensely competitive affairs, seeking the IFT's Julius T. Nachazel Trophy. With radical curving shots, deflected Frisbees bobbled frantically among teammates, and spectacular diving catches, guts had become an extreme sport demanding fast reflexes, physical endurance, and concentration.\n\nSince its rise in the 1970s, when even ABC's Wide World of Sports was televising guts action, and numerous tournaments were springing up, from Toronto to Chicago and Los Angeles, the sport has gradually declined in popularity in America. Guts had been introduced in Asia by the toy company Wham-O in the 1970s, and by the 1990s it had become even more popular in Japan and Taiwan than in the US. Recent years, however, have seen pockets of strong new American players renewing competitive American interest in the game, also drawing some older players out of \"retirement\".\n\nDocumentary by Early Spring Productions.

His books have been translated into all the world's major languages, and his unique blend of historical perspective and social commentary has been the inspiration for social activists seeking progressive alternatives to capitalism and communism. \n\nFrom his early childhood in Bihar, India, where he was born in 1921, Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar has been attracting others by his deep love for humanity and guiding them along the path of self-realization. Adjusting the ancient science of Tantra Yoga to meet the needs of this age, he developed a scientific and rational philosophy (based on the immanence and transcendence of God) and taught a system of practical spiritual disciplines for physical, mental and spiritual development. Recognizing him as a spiritually realized master, his followers called him Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, which means, \"He who attracts others as the embodiment of bliss\", or simply \"Baba\" (father). \nThose who followed his teachings found their lives transformed as they overcame the weaknesses and negative tendencies of the mind to experience a deep peace and bliss within. Inspired by his selfless example, they focused their efforts on serving the society and elevating the oppressed.]\n\nÁNANDA MÁRGA: \"Path of Bliss\"\nAnanda means \"bliss\" and Marga means \"path.\"\nSo Ananda Marga means \"Path of Bliss.\"\n\nBliss is infinite happiness. It is the fundamental desire of human beings. \"There is in the living being a thirst for limitlessness.\" We can never be satisfied with limited things. They may give us pleasure for a while, but not long-lasting satisfaction. A limited object can only give a temporary and limited amount of happiness. But only infinite happiness will satisfy us. So how are we to attain it? By expanding our awareness to infinity; by transforming our individual limited experience into the cosmic experience of the unlimited: infinite happiness; perfect peace and contentment bliss.\n\nAnanda Marga is the name of the system which allows us to do that. It is an optimal selection of those techniques and practices that lead to the total experience of infinite peace and happiness what we call \"self-realization.\" It is an ideology and way of life; a systematic and scientific process for the fulfillment of all human needs: physical, mental and spiritual. It is introversial, intuitional practice; with techniques ranging from personal hygiene to yoga postures; from social service to meditation. Its goal is the all-round elevation of human beings, both individually and collectively, in all spheres of human existence: individual, social, economic, intellectual and spiritual. It is a total response to human longing and aspiration.\n\nAs an organization, Ananda Marga has a global network of centers in virtually every country of the world. Its activities encompass a wide range of projects for the welfare of humanity, animals, plants and the whole planet. These include yoga and meditation centers, schools, childrens homes, food distribution centers, disaster relief, medical centers and community development projects. Emphasis is placed on meeting the needs of the local people and assisting them in developing their personal and social resources for the prosperity of all.\n\nThe philosophy of Ananda Marga is one of universalism. It is an all-embracing outlook, recognizing God as the one limitless supreme consciousness, with all beings of the universe part of the one cosmic family.\n\nIt recognizes that a balance is needed between the spiritual and mundane aspects of existence, and that neither one should be neglected at the expense of the other. Hence the goal of Ananda Marga is \"Self-realization and the welfare of the universe.\"\n\nAnanda Marga is a global spiritual and social service organization founded in 1955 by Shrii Shrii Anandamurti (Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar). The mission of Ananda Marga is self-realization (individual emancipation) and service to humanity (collective welfare): the fulfillment of the physical, mental and spiritual needs of all people.

        "description": "Teresa Teng was born 61 years ago today, January 29th 1953 in Baozhong, Yunlin County, Taiwan. This video is my way of saying \"Teresa ... thank you so much for all that you gave to the world.\" It is a song from her 1974 album \"青山绿水我和你 (Mountains, You and Me}, and from the film \"\"When I already knew Love\".  It shows the dynamic side of Teresa Teng, full of youthful exhuberance. By 1971, she had already recorded 21 albums, having started as a 14-year-old in 1967. I knew what a wonderful singer of beautiful, tender songs she was, but I didn't realise what electricity and vibrance she had in songs such as this one and others such as 'Stranger' and ' Go Back to North Nanshan Mountain'.  Teresa sang all types of songs with equal expertise and feeling, and in several different languages. \n\n\nShe truly deserved the accolades she received, and although she only lived for 42 years, she left us with the most beautiful of treasures. I like this tribute particularly.\n\"She has left us for 16 years, but her smile, song and dance are still alive among Chinese people and touch the softest chord of our souls. When we listen to her songs and respond from the bottom of our heart, we find that she is already a part of our life\". \n\nTeresa influenced Chinese society so much as a singer that she was honored by the expression \"Anywhere there are Chinese people, there are Teresa Teng's songs\". In 2010, American program CNN conducted an online poll called the \"Top Five Global Music Icons\". Teresa, along with Leslie Cheung, was selected for the Top 20 world famous prominent singers in the past 50 years. Quite simply, she was unique.\n\nAlthough she soon became an international super star, in Taiwan she was known as \"the soldier's sweetheart\" because of her frequent performances for servicemen. She was herself the child of a military family. Her concerts for troops featured popular music and Taiwanese folk songs that appealed to all as well as Chinese folk songs that appealed to homesick refugees of the civil war. \n\nShe performed in Paris during the 1989 Tiananmen student protests on behalf of the students and proclaimed her support for democracy. On May 27, 1989, over 300,000 people attended the concert called \"Democratic songs dedicated to China\" Her hopes of performing one day in mainland China never materialized. The Communist Party of China eventually invited her to do so in the 1990s but she died before having the opportunity. Teresa died from a severe asthma attack while on holiday in Chiang Mai, Thailand, at the age of 42, on May 8, 1995. She had been an asthmatic throughout her adult life. She was given state honors at her funeral in Taiwan, with the flag of the Republic of China draped over her casket. \n\nBut as she lives on in her music, today I must say \"Happy Birthday, Teresa ... and thank you.\"\n\nEnglish Translation of Lyrics\nHow much a night \nYou and me be together \nAs long as you do not abandon me \nI will always be with you \nQuiet night \nMemories of the past into \nXingyue know my heart \nLove you never hate you \nTen million ten million prayers \nAnd you be together again \nAs long as you do not forget me \nI'll always be waiting for you \nQuiet night \nMemories of the past into \nXingyue know my heart \nLove you never hate you \n\nMandarin\n曲：古月\n詞：苔宜\n\n多少多少個夜裡\n我和你相偎相依\n隻要你不把我拋棄\n我會永遠伴著你\n靜靜的夜裡\n往事成回憶\n星月知道我的心\n愛你永遠不恨你\n\n千萬千萬個祈禱\n再和你相偎相依\n隻要你不把我忘記\n我會永遠等著你\n靜靜的夜裡\n往事成回憶\n星月知道我的心\n愛你永遠不恨你",

        "description": "Taiwan’s top military official among 8 killed in copter crash\nTAIPEI, Taiwan —  Taiwan’s top military official was killed in an air force helicopter crash Thursday morning that killed seven other people, the defense ministry said. Five people survived the crash in mountains outside the capital.\nAs chief of the general staff, Gen. Shen Yi-ming was responsible for overseeing the island’s defense against China, which threatens to use military force to annex what it considers it own territory.\n\nThe helicopter was flying from Taipei to the northeastern city of Ilan for a new year’s activity when it crashed.\n\nAccording to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, 13 people were on the UH-60M Blackhawk helicopter, which took off shortly after 7:50 a.m. from Taipei’s Songshan air force base on its way to a base in Yilan county on the east coast. Just over 10 minutes later, it dropped from the radar screen and went down in the mountainous, heavily forested Wulai area southeast of the capital.\n\nShen, 63, had taken over as chief of the general staff in July after serving as commander of Taiwan’s air force, which is undergoing a substantial upgrade with the arrival of the most advanced version of the U.S. F-16V fighter.\n\nAlexander Huang, a strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan who had known Shen for a decade, said he had stood out as a pilot and an officer.\n\n“He was very calm and very stable and unlike other army guys he was always smiling, so he got a specific leadership style that also made him a popular leader in the entire military,” Huang said.\n\nIt will likely be months before the cause of the crash is known, but the pilots, both of whom were killed, appeared to have been highly experienced.\n\n“Of course, reasonable people would think in the direction of mechanical failure or maintenance problem, but without proof you can’t say anything,” Huang said.\n\nTaiwan’s military has operated Blackhawks for decades and in 2010, completed a sale for another 60 UH-Ms from the U.S. for $3.1 billion.",

        "description": "Electrostatical Loudspeakers       Almost every one of us knows, what a speaker is. The majority of us are also aware of how it works. However, a dynamic speaker has one interesting peculiarity - the voice coil seeks to not only jump forward, but also to turn over, so there is a slight lateral effort, which causes insignificant distortions to appear in the sound and requires strengthening. As a result, the diffuser becomes heavy, which prevents large and powerful speakers from reproducing high frequencies at a decent quality level.       Electrostatic loudspeakers are a good alternative to regular speakers. They are known for virtually the purest sound among all the acoustic systems. Air in these devices moves based on the electrostatic principle - in similarity with how the same charged particles repel from each other, while the oppositely charged ones are attracted to each other.       A typical electrostatic panel is a three-layered sandwich, where the finest mylar film is located between 2 perforated metal plates called the stators. In conventional electrostatic panels the sound signal is supplied to the stators, and the electrostatic charges of each of such stators repel or attract the virtually weightless mylar, while immediately moving the air and accurately reproducing the sound waves. This is possible because the other forces that cause the lateral effort or anything else for that matter are not there.       For correct operation electrostatic loudspeakers require 5,000 V on static electrodes. That's why it is extremely important to follow all the safety instructions, especially if you have kids at home.  Contact with loudspeakers at the time of their operation can be very dangerous.",

        "description": "www.gezahosszulegocky.com\n\nBiography of Geza Hosszu Legocky\n\nPraised by musicians, audiences, and music critics as a rising \"tour de force\" in the classical music scene, Géza Hosszu-Legocky's critical acclaim culminated with the nomination of two Grammy® Awards, including the \"Best Classical Music Album 2005\" and \"Best Chamber Music Recording 2005\" for his recording of the Schumann Violin Sonata in A minor and other chamber music works with an all-star cast including Martha Argerich, Maxim Vengerov, Lilya Zilberstein, and Gabriela Montero on EMI Classics recorded in 2004. In 2003, he released his first EMI Classics recording performing traditional Hungarian Gypsy music with his ensemble \"The 5 DeVils\".\n\nKnown for his passionate and fiery interpretations of classical, jazz, and Hungarian gypsy music, he first made his public debut at the age of 9 on Austrian Television \"ORF\". Since then, he has performed with the National Hungarian Orchestra of Budapest and performed in Argentina, France, Germany, Spain, Japan, Italy, and the USA.\n\nAs a guest soloist, he has been invited to perform with the major orchestras and ensembles throughout the world including the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France with Myung-Whun Chung, NHK Orchestra in Tokyo with Charles Dutoit, and the Kremerata Baltica with Gidon Kremer. His regular chamber music partners include Martha Argerich, Gautier Capucon, Renaud Capucon, Nelson Freire, Ivry Gitlis, Ida Haendel, Gabriela Montero, Vadim Repin, and Giorgia Tomassi.\n\nHe continues to perform regularly at the top music festivals around the world including Aspen Festival (USA), Beppu Festival (Japan), Buenos Aires Festival (Argentina), Ludwigsburg Festival (Germany), Lugano Festival (Italy), Ruhr Piano Festival (Germany), Saratoga Festival (USA), Taipei Festival (Taiwan), Verbier Music Festival (Switzerland), and many others. In 1999 and 2000, he performed in sold-out concerts at the prestigious Verbier Festival with Roby Lakatos and Friends which also included artists such as Ida Haendel, Vadim Repin, and Sayaka Shoji. In 2003, he was invited by the Violin Festival in Cassis (France) to perform with Martha Argerich, Ruggiero Ricci, and Ivry Gitlis. At the 2005 Saratoga Festival, Géza made his recital debut with Martha Argerich to thunderous standing ovations.\n\nHe continues to perform in recitals and concerts in the world's most renowned concert halls including Salle de Pleyel (Paris), Teatro Color (Buenos Aires), Théâtre des Champes Elysees (Paris), and Auditorium du Louvre (Paris).\n\n2001 was a year of significant attention for Géza. He was among only the selected few young artists from around the world invited to participate in the prestigious Dorothy Delay Symposium and Master Classes at the Juilliard School of Music in the class of violinist Robert McDuffie. Upon hearing him, McDuffie immediately engaged him to perform at the Aspen Music Festival in an international concert broadcast on NPR, reaching over three million listeners worldwide.\n\nOffstage, Géza has made a cameo appearance as a gypsy violinist in Francois Girard's 1998 Academy-award winning film The Red Violin. In 2001, he and Martha Argerich were profiled in Georges Gachot's feature film Conversations Nocturnes. This documentary was exhibited at the world's major international film festivals, including the Cannes Film Festival and won numerous awards including the PRIX ITALIA 2002 Documentary on \"Music and Arts\".\n\nIn addition to classical music, Géza has a passion for performing traditional Hungarian gypsy music and created his award-winning ensemble \"The 5 DeVils\" and have performed at the major festivals in South America and Europe.\n\nGéza was born in 1985 and is a top honours student at the Vienna Academy of Music. His teachers and coaches have included Ruggiero Ricci, Ivry Gitlis, Ida Haendel, Tibor Varga, Dora Schwarzberg, and Marina Sokorova. He holds a dual Swiss and American citizenship and currently resides in Lausanne, Switzerland.",

          "description": "www.gezahosszulegocky.com\n\nBiography of Geza Hosszu Legocky\n\nPraised by musicians, audiences, and music critics as a rising \"tour de force\" in the classical music scene, Géza Hosszu-Legocky's critical acclaim culminated with the nomination of two Grammy® Awards, including the \"Best Classical Music Album 2005\" and \"Best Chamber Music Recording 2005\" for his recording of the Schumann Violin Sonata in A minor and other chamber music works with an all-star cast including Martha Argerich, Maxim Vengerov, Lilya Zilberstein, and Gabriela Montero on EMI Classics recorded in 2004. In 2003, he released his first EMI Classics recording performing traditional Hungarian Gypsy music with his ensemble \"The 5 DeVils\".\n\nKnown for his passionate and fiery interpretations of classical, jazz, and Hungarian gypsy music, he first made his public debut at the age of 9 on Austrian Television \"ORF\". Since then, he has performed with the National Hungarian Orchestra of Budapest and performed in Argentina, France, Germany, Spain, Japan, Italy, and the USA.\n\nAs a guest soloist, he has been invited to perform with the major orchestras and ensembles throughout the world including the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France with Myung-Whun Chung, NHK Orchestra in Tokyo with Charles Dutoit, and the Kremerata Baltica with Gidon Kremer. His regular chamber music partners include Martha Argerich, Gautier Capucon, Renaud Capucon, Nelson Freire, Ivry Gitlis, Ida Haendel, Gabriela Montero, Vadim Repin, and Giorgia Tomassi.\n\nHe continues to perform regularly at the top music festivals around the world including Aspen Festival (USA), Beppu Festival (Japan), Buenos Aires Festival (Argentina), Ludwigsburg Festival (Germany), Lugano Festival (Italy), Ruhr Piano Festival (Germany), Saratoga Festival (USA), Taipei Festival (Taiwan), Verbier Music Festival (Switzerland), and many others. In 1999 and 2000, he performed in sold-out concerts at the prestigious Verbier Festival with Roby Lakatos and Friends which also included artists such as Ida Haendel, Vadim Repin, and Sayaka Shoji. In 2003, he was invited by the Violin Festival in Cassis (France) to perform with Martha Argerich, Ruggiero Ricci, and Ivry Gitlis. At the 2005 Saratoga Festival, Géza made his recital debut with Martha Argerich to thunderous standing ovations.\n\nHe continues to perform in recitals and concerts in the world's most renowned concert halls including Salle de Pleyel (Paris), Teatro Color (Buenos Aires), Théâtre des Champes Elysees (Paris), and Auditorium du Louvre (Paris).\n\n2001 was a year of significant attention for Géza. He was among only the selected few young artists from around the world invited to participate in the prestigious Dorothy Delay Symposium and Master Classes at the Juilliard School of Music in the class of violinist Robert McDuffie. Upon hearing him, McDuffie immediately engaged him to perform at the Aspen Music Festival in an international concert broadcast on NPR, reaching over three million listeners worldwide.\n\nOffstage, Géza has made a cameo appearance as a gypsy violinist in Francois Girard's 1998 Academy-award winning film The Red Violin. In 2001, he and Martha Argerich were profiled in Georges Gachot's feature film Conversations Nocturnes. This documentary was exhibited at the world's major international film festivals, including the Cannes Film Festival and won numerous awards including the PRIX ITALIA 2002 Documentary on \"Music and Arts\".\n\nIn addition to classical music, Géza has a passion for performing traditional Hungarian gypsy music and created his award-winning ensemble \"The 5 DeVils\" and have performed at the major festivals in South America and Europe.\n\nGéza was born in 1985 and is a top honours student at the Vienna Academy of Music. His teachers and coaches have included Ruggiero Ricci, Ivry Gitlis, Ida Haendel, Tibor Varga, Dora Schwarzberg, and Marina Sokorova.

In 2003, he released his first EMI Classics recording performing traditional Hungarian Gypsy music with his ensemble \"The 5 DeVils\".\r\n\r\nKnown for his passionate and fiery interpretations of classical, jazz, and Hungarian gypsy music, he first made his public debut at the age of 9 on Austrian Television \"ORF\". Since then, he has performed with the National Hungarian Orchestra of Budapest and performed in Argentina, France, Germany, Spain, Japan, Italy, and the USA.\r\n\r\nAs a guest soloist, he has been invited to perform with the major orchestras and ensembles throughout the world including the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France with Myung-Whun Chung, NHK Orchestra in Tokyo with Charles Dutoit, and the Kremerata Baltica with Gidon Kremer. His regular chamber music partners include Martha Argerich, Gautier Capucon, Renaud Capucon, Nelson Freire, Ivry Gitlis, Ida Haendel, Gabriela Montero, Vadim Repin, and Giorgia Tomassi.\r\n\r\nHe continues to perform regularly at the top music festivals around the world including Aspen Festival (USA), Beppu Festival (Japan), Buenos Aires Festival (Argentina), Ludwigsburg Festival (Germany), Lugano Festival (Italy), Ruhr Piano Festival (Germany), Saratoga Festival (USA), Taipei Festival (Taiwan), Verbier Music Festival (Switzerland), and many others. In 1999 and 2000, he performed in sold-out concerts at the prestigious Verbier Festival with Roby Lakatos and Friends which also included artists such as Ida Haendel, Vadim Repin, and Sayaka Shoji. In 2003, he was invited by the Violin Festival in Cassis (France) to perform with Martha Argerich, Ruggiero Ricci, and Ivry Gitlis. At the 2005 Saratoga Festival, Géza made his recital debut with Martha Argerich to thunderous standing ovations.\r\n\r\nHe continues to perform in recitals and concerts in the world's most renowned concert halls including Salle de Pleyel (Paris), Teatro Color (Buenos Aires), Théâtre des Champes Elysees (Paris), and Auditorium du Louvre (Paris).\r\n\r\n2001 was a year of significant attention for Géza. He was among only the selected few young artists from around the world invited to participate in the prestigious Dorothy Delay Symposium and Master Classes at the Juilliard School of Music in the class of violinist Robert McDuffie. Upon hearing him, McDuffie immediately engaged him to perform at the Aspen Music Festival in an international concert broadcast on NPR, reaching over three million listeners worldwide.\r\n\r\nOffstage, Géza has made a cameo appearance as a gypsy violinist in Francois Girard's 1998 Academy-award winning film The Red Violin. In 2001, he and Martha Argerich were profiled in Georges Gachot's feature film Conversations Nocturnes. This documentary was exhibited at the world's major international film festivals, including the Cannes Film Festival and won numerous awards including the PRIX ITALIA 2002 Documentary on \"Music and Arts\". \r\n\r\nIn addition to classical music, Géza has a passion for performing traditional Hungarian gypsy music and created his award-winning ensemble \"The 5 DeVils\" and have performed at the major festivals in South America and Europe.\r\n\r\nGéza was born in 1985 and is a top honours student at the Vienna Academy of Music. His teachers and coaches have included Ruggiero Ricci, Ivry Gitlis, Ida Haendel, Tibor Varga, Dora Schwarzberg, and Marina Sokorova. He holds a dual Swiss and American citizenship and currently resides in Lausanne, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nFor more information, you are welcome to visit Geza's Official Home Page here:\r\nhttp://gezahosszulegocky.com/home.html",

        "description": "Modern enka (演歌 — from 演 en performance, entertainment, and 歌 ka song) came into being in the postwar years of the Showa period. It was the first style to synthesize the Japanese pentatonic scale with Western harmonies. Enka lyrics, as in Portuguese Fado, usually are about the themes of love and loss, loneliness, enduring hardships, and persevering in the face of difficulties, even suicide or death. Enka suggests a more traditional, idealized, or romanticized aspect of Japanese culture and attitudes, comparable to American country and western music.\nThe most well-known and beloved performer of this genre is Hibari Misora (1937--1989), who was known as the \"Queen of Enka\" and \"Queen of Showa\" for the period (1926--1989) when she lived and was most popular.\nIn recent decades, enka music has declined in sales and in recognition as American-like J-Pop music has become more popular, and enka's traditional themes are no longer appreciated among younger Japanese generations. However, there are still many in Japan who enjoy this genre. Its popularity among younger Japanese people has increased lately because of singer Kiyoshi Hikawa and the early solo releases of then-Morning Musume member Yuko Nakazawa. Enka singers, who are predominantly women, usually perform in a kimono or in evening dress. Male enka performers tend to wear formal dress, or in some performances, traditional attire.\nNods to traditional Japanese music are common in enka, usually in the form of an interlude featuring instruments like the shinobue and the shamisen. Besides television, enka can be heard in many restaurants, drinking establishments, karaoke bars, and cafes.\nIn the United States, enka continues to remain popular among a section of the (typically older) Japanese-American population, and enka also has many fans among non-Japanese. There are some enka orchestras and performers active in the U.S., such as the San Jose Chidori Band, which occasionally performs at O-Bon festivals in the summer.\n\n1.好きで呑んでる お酒じゃないわ\nひとりが淋しい 片恋酒よ\n遊び上手な あなたでも\n噂を聞く度 逢いたくて\nつらいのよ つらいのよ\nバカな女と 言われても\n忘れられない 恋だから\n面影グラスに 忍び泣く\n2.荒れた生活の 今日この頃は\n酔う程未練が 身にしみるのよ\n夢で激しく 燃えるより\nやさしい強さで 抱きしめて\n欲しいのよ 欲しいのよ\nバカな女と 言われても\n忘れれられない恋だから\n面影グラスに 忍び泣く\n3.「あなた命」 とボトルに書いて\n心に注ぎたす 片恋酒よ\n愛の傷あと 痛む夜は\nいい事ばかりを 思い出し\n生きるのよ 生きるのよ\nバカな女と 言われても\n忘れられない恋だから\n面影グラスに 忍び泣く\n\n(Synopsis of the first part of the Japanse lyrics)\n\"I am not taking Sake (wine) for preference.\nThis is a one-way-love wine, because I miss you.\nEven though you are playing around,\nI cannot help thinking of you, wishing to see you,\nEach time when I hear about your rumor.\nI am weeping in secret, with a glass, thinking about you,\nBecause this is unforgettable love,\nEven if I am talked as a silly woman.\"\n\nThe rest part of the Japanese lyrics expresses similar content to the above.\n\n好きで呑んでる　お酒じゃないわ\nSuki de nonderu osake ja naiwa\nひとりが淋しい　片恋酒よ\nHitori ga samishii katakoi-zake yo\n遊び上手な　あなたでも\nAsobi jouzu na anata demo\n噂を聞く度　逢いたくて\nUwasa wo kikutabi aitakute\nつらいのよ　つらいのよ\nTsurainyo tsurainoyo\nバカな女と　言われても\nBaka na onna to iwaretemo\n忘れられない　恋だから\nWasurerarenai koi dakara\n面影グラスに　忍びなく\nOmokage gurasu (glass) ni shinobi naku\n\n荒れた生活の　今日この頃は\nAreta kurashi no kyou konogoro wa\n酔う程未練が　身にしみるのよ\nYou hodo miren ga mi ni shimiru noyo\n夢で激しく燃えるより\nYume de hageshiku moeru yori\nやさしい強さで　抱きしめて\nYasashii tsuyosa de dakishimete\n欲しいのよ　欲しいのよ\nHoshii noyo hoshii noyo\nバカな女と言われても\nBaka na onna to iwaretemo\n忘れられない　恋だから\nWasurerarenai koi dakara\n面影グラスに　忍びなく\nOmokage gurasu (glass) ni shinobi naku\n\n「あなた命」と　ボドルに書いて\nAnata Inochi to botoru (bottle) ni kaite\n心に注ぎたす　片恋酒よ\nKokoro ni tsugidasu katakoi-zake yo\n愛の傷あと　痛む夜は\nAi no kizuato itamu yo wa\nいい事ばかりを　思い出し\nIikoto bakari wo omoidashi\n生きるのよ　生きるのよ\nIkiru noyo ikiru noyo\nバカな女と言われても\nBaka na onna to iwaretemo\n忘れられない　恋だから\nWasurerarenai koi dakara\n面影グラスに　忍びなく\nOmokage gurasu (glass) ni shinobi naku",

        "title": "Teresa Teng -- Nung   但愿人长久-邓丽君 1983",
        "description": "A wonderful recording by Teresa from her magnificent1983 Polygram album \" Dandanyouqing\"(Light Exquisite Feelings) 淡淡幽情 which has sold over 5 million copies. Nung is one of 12 songs that are based on poems written during the Tang(宋)and Song(宋)dynasties. The writer was Su Shi (蘇軾) a much revered poet from the Song Dynasty. Su Shi was born on January 8, 1037, and died on August 24, 1101. He wrote the very Taoist 水調歌頭(Thinking of You) in 1076, when he was 39 years old.  As he looks up at the moon, during the Harvest Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, he thinks of those far away from him. It had been a difficult period for him, politically and vocationally. He was a magistrate in Mizhou. Amongst those in his thoughts are his younger brother Su Zhe whom he hadn't seen for 7 years.  Zi You(子由) as he was known, was also a famous writer, living in Jinan. \n\nAs a prefix to this poem he wrote 丙辰中秋，歡飲達旦，大醉，作此篇，兼懷子由。which translates as \"Mid-autumn of the Bing Chen year / Having been drinking happily over night  /  I'm drunk  / So I write this poem  /  Remembering my brother, Zi You. In China, the full moon symbolises fulfillment of life and the noblest of feelings. It makes one feel inspired and romantic. In this poem, Su Shi's thoughts and feelings have wings, and are moving between Heaven and Earth. It is considered a classic poem of its genre. \n\nTime itself is a feature here. \"Nung\" is the title of the song as I know it, though the Chinese title 但愿人长久 (Dan Yuan Ren Chang Jiu) can be translated in many ways. Wishing You A Long Life, Well Wishes to us Forever, May we all be blessed with longevity, Wish we could live long lives, Wishing We Last Forever. Take your pick!

          "description": "A wonderful recording by Teresa from her magnificent1983 Polygram album \" Dandanyouqing\"(Light Exquisite Feelings) 淡淡幽情 which has sold over 5 million copies. Nung is one of 12 songs that are based on poems written during the Tang(宋)and Song(宋)dynasties. The writer was Su Shi (蘇軾) a much revered poet from the Song Dynasty. Su Shi was born on January 8, 1037, and died on August 24, 1101. He wrote the very Taoist 水調歌頭(Thinking of You) in 1076, when he was 39 years old.  As he looks up at the moon, during the Harvest Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, he thinks of those far away from him. It had been a difficult period for him, politically and vocationally. He was a magistrate in Mizhou. Amongst those in his thoughts are his younger brother Su Zhe whom he hadn't seen for 7 years.  Zi You(子由) as he was known, was also a famous writer, living in Jinan. \n\nAs a prefix to this poem he wrote 丙辰中秋，歡飲達旦，大醉，作此篇，兼懷子由。which translates as \"Mid-autumn of the Bing Chen year / Having been drinking happily over night  /  I'm drunk  / So I write this poem  /  Remembering my brother, Zi You. In China, the full moon symbolises fulfillment of life and the noblest of feelings. It makes one feel inspired and romantic. In this poem, Su Shi's thoughts and feelings have wings, and are moving between Heaven and Earth. It is considered a classic poem of its genre. \n\nTime itself is a feature here. \"Nung\" is the title of the song as I know it, though the Chinese title 但愿人长久 (Dan Yuan Ren Chang Jiu) can be translated in many ways. Wishing You A Long Life, Well Wishes to us Forever, May we all be blessed with longevity, Wish we could live long lives, Wishing We Last Forever. Take your pick!

        "title": "Lexus LX 570 جيب لكزس",
        "description": "Lexus LX 570 جيب لكزس\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 2007, Lexus debuted the 2008 LX 570 at the New York International Auto Show. The LX 570 was a complete redesign of the LX, and the first version of Lexus' largest SUV to premiere before its expected Land Cruiser counterpart. The LX 570 features a new ULEV-II certified 5.7 L 3UR-FE V8 engine.[11]  Total engine output is rated at 383 horsepower (286 kW) and 403 ft·lbf (546 N·m) of torque. The more powerful engine helps give the LX an increased towing capacity of up to 8,500 pounds. The engine is tied to a six-speed sequential-shift automatic transmission with an all-new 4WD system which uses an electronic Torsen center differential.[12] Notably, the latest LX loses the plastic lower body side cladding leaving the paint exposed and Night View is discontinued.\r\nLexus LX 570 (URJ200; Europe)\r\n\r\nCompared to its predecessor, the LX 570 is 4 inches (102 mm) longer overall and 1 inch (25 mm) wider, while retaining the same wheelbase length. A third of the frame's body mass is made from high-tensile steel, along with the entire B-pillar, and all three crossmembers which are made from hydroformed steel. Like the Toyota Tundra the tow hitch is integrated into the frame.\r\n\r\nThe front suspension now uses double wishbones replacing the previous torsion beam which offers 9 inches (230 mm) of suspension travel while the rear continues to use a multi-link suspension with a solid rear axle for strength and durability. The LX 570 comes standard with 20 in (510 mm)-wheels, a four-wheel electro-hydraulic suspension with an updated six-setting Active Height Control (AHC) system that can raise the vehicle by three inches or lower it by 2 inches (51 mm) from its normal ride height using a knob located in the center console. The front suspension's air bag spring rates are also variable but not continuously like a fully active suspension arrangement.\r\nLexus LX 570 (URJ200; Europe)\r\n\r\nThe Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) provides more immediate damper firmness adjustments which are diagonally cross-linked linked through a mechanical system using hydraulic fluid similar to the 4Runner's X-REAS system. Other performance features include a Crawl Control (more advanced version of Downhill Assist Control) system which will negotiate off-road obstacles in both forward and reverse at low speeds by automatically providing throttle and braking inputs for less experienced off-road drivers, an interior lever allows the driver to reduce speed as the vehicle travels. A multi-terrain anti-lock braking system allows for shorter stopping distances on surfaces such as sand or gravel. Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) prevents the vehicle from rolling backwards on hills or slippery surfaces.[12] According to its manufacturer, the LX platform has logged 240,000 test kilometers through subtropical forests, the Australian Outback, and various American deserts.\r\n\r\nThe LX 570's interior design includes a number of the amenities, standard and optional, featured in the 2007 LS 460, such as semi-aniline leather seats, four-zone climate control, a 19-speaker 450 Watt Mark Levinson surround sound stereo system with hard drive memory storage, a hard-drive based navigation system, XM satellite radio with NavTraffic is standard, a two-piece power liftgate/tailgate and Lexus Intuitive Park Assist, a sonar parking assist feature. Other features include Bubinga wood trim (a form of African rosewood also used in private aircraft and high-quality instruments), a center console cooler for storage of cold drinks, power sliding rear seats, power third row seats, and a 9-inch (230 mm) DVD rear-seat entertainment system.[12] A new Wide-view Front and Side Monitor system uses a camera mounted on the grill giving a 180 degree view in front and another camera mounted on the passenger side of the vehicle's side mirror helps eliminate blind spots on the side at low speeds useful in parking lots or off-road adventures.\r\nLexus LX 570 (URJ200) forward interior\r\n\r\nThe new LX will not be sold or offered to the Japanese market, but is available in Russia, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan, Middle East, and North America by Lexus, and in these regions Toyota also sells the related Land Cruiser. The LX is not available in the rest of the world or in Europe, where the Toyota LandCruiser 200 is sold. Its major competitors are the Cadillac Escalade, Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX56, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, and Audi Q7. In 2009, the LX 570 received J.D. Power's top score among all vehicles in its Initial Quality Study.[13]",

          "description": "Lexus LX 570 جيب لكزس\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 2007, Lexus debuted the 2008 LX 570 at the New York International Auto Show. The LX 570 was a complete redesign of the LX, and the first version of Lexus' largest SUV to premiere before its expected Land Cruiser counterpart. The LX 570 features a new ULEV-II certified 5.7 L 3UR-FE V8 engine.[11]  Total engine output is rated at 383 horsepower (286 kW) and 403 ft·lbf (546 N·m) of torque. The more powerful engine helps give the LX an increased towing capacity of up to 8,500 pounds. The engine is tied to a six-speed sequential-shift automatic transmission with an all-new 4WD system which uses an electronic Torsen center differential.[12] Notably, the latest LX loses the plastic lower body side cladding leaving the paint exposed and Night View is discontinued.\r\nLexus LX 570 (URJ200; Europe)\r\n\r\nCompared to its predecessor, the LX 570 is 4 inches (102 mm) longer overall and 1 inch (25 mm) wider, while retaining the same wheelbase length. A third of the frame's body mass is made from high-tensile steel, along with the entire B-pillar, and all three crossmembers which are made from hydroformed steel. Like the Toyota Tundra the tow hitch is integrated into the frame.\r\n\r\nThe front suspension now uses double wishbones replacing the previous torsion beam which offers 9 inches (230 mm) of suspension travel while the rear continues to use a multi-link suspension with a solid rear axle for strength and durability.

To date, four seasons have been aired. It is shown in 180 territories.\r\nCreated by Neville Astley\r\nMark Baker\r\nWritten by Neville Astley\r\nMark Baker\r\nPhillip Hall\r\nDirected by Neville Astley\r\nMark Baker\r\nPhillip Hall (2011)\r\nJoris van Hulzen (2011)\r\n [1]\r\nBackground\r\nPeppa Pig is a children's television programme broadcasting on Channel 5 and Nick Jr. in the UK, Nickelodeon/Nick Jr. in USA, ABC 4 Kids in Australia and Discovery Kids in Latin America, including Brazil. Each episode is approximately 5 minutes long. The show revolves around Peppa, an anthropomorphic female pig, and her family and friends. Each of her friends is a different species of mammal. Peppa's friends are the same age as she, and Peppa's younger brother George's friends are the same age as him. Episodes tend to feature everyday activities such as attending playgroup, going swimming, visiting their grandparents, cousins, going to the playground or riding bikes.\r\nThe characters wear clothes, live in houses, and drive cars, but still display some characteristics of the animals on which they are based. Peppa and her family snort like pigs during conversations in which they are speaking in English, the other animals make their respective noises when they talk, with some exhibiting other characteristics, such as the Rabbit family's enjoyment of carrots. The Rabbits are also the sole exception to the rule of human-like habitation, in that they live in a burrow in a hill, although it does have windows and is furnished in the same way as the other houses. The characters also blush when embarrassed and their mouths are used to express other emotions such as sadness, happiness, irritation, bewilderment and confusion. Although the mammals are anthropomorphic, other animals are not, for example, the ducks, Tiddles the tortoise, and Polly Parrot.\r\nThe first series of 52 five-minute episodes started on Channel 5 on 31 May 2004, and had its American premiere as part of Cartoon Network's Tickle-U preschool television programming block on 22 August 2005, and Noggin in December 2007 and January 2008. As of 2014, the series currently airs on the Nick Jr. channel in the US. In the United Kingdom, it can also be seen on Nick Jr., the same with Portugal, Italy, Benelux, Scandinavia and Australia. In Taiwan, the show can be seen on Playhouse Disney. The second series of 52 episodes began on Channel 5 on Monday 4 September 2006, with Cecily Bloom replacing Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa, amongst other cast changes. The third series started broadcasting on the Channel 5 kids block, Milkshake! on 4 May 2009 with Harley Bird replacing Cecily Bloom and Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa Pig.",

    "description": "Peppa Pig English Episodes Games - Peppa Pig The New House 2014\nMy Face page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HDTVAllepisodesCartoons?ref=hl\nMy google + page:\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/114798146458175420564/posts?hl=tr\nMy Youtube Channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/GameplayCartoon\n\nPeppa Pig is a children's television programme broadcasting on Channel 5 and Nick Jr. in the UK, Nickelodeon/Nick Jr. in USA, ABC 4 Kids in Australia and Discovery Kids in Latin America, including Brazil. Each episode is approximately 5 minutes long. The show revolves around Peppa, an anthropomorphic female pig, and her family and friends. Each of her friends is a different species of mammal. Peppa's friends are the same age as she, and Peppa's younger brother George's friends are the same age as him. Episodes tend to feature everyday activities such as attending playgroup, going swimming, visiting their grandparents, cousins, going to the playground or riding bikes.\n\nThe characters wear clothes, live in houses, and drive cars, but still display some characteristics of the animals on which they are based. Peppa and her family snort like pigs during conversations in which they are speaking in English, the other animals make their respective noises when they talk, with some exhibiting other characteristics, such as the Rabbit family's enjoyment of carrots. The Rabbits are also the sole exception to the rule of human-like habitation, in that they live in a burrow in a hill, although it does have windows and is furnished in the same way as the other houses. The characters also blush when embarrassed and their mouths are used to express other emotions such as sadness, happiness, irritation, bewilderment and confusion. Although the mammals are anthropomorphic, other animals are not, for example, the ducks, Tiddles the tortoise, and Polly Parrot. In addition, a narrator reinforces the action and humor, saying things like \"Oh, dear\" when something unfortunate happens (such as George starts crying) or \"Look out!\" when a character is doing something unsafe (such as Peppa riding her bicycle without looking where she's going).\n\nThe first series of 52 five-minute episodes started on Channel 5 on 31 May 2004, and had its American premiere as part of Cartoon Network's Tickle-U preschool television programming block on 22 August 2005, and Noggin in December 2007 and January 2008.

In the United Kingdom, it can also be seen on Nick Jr., the same with Portugal, Italy, Benelux, Scandinavia and Australia. In Taiwan, the show can be seen on Playhouse Disney. The second series of 52 episodes began on Channel 5 on Monday 4 September 2006, with Cecily Bloom replacing Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa, amongst other cast changes. The third series started broadcasting on the Channel 5 kids block, Milkshake! on 4 May 2009 with Harley Bird replacing Cecily Bloom and Lily Snowden-Fine as\n====================================\nPeppa pig\nPeppa pig english episodes\npeppa pig games\npeppa pig full screen\npeppa pig new episodes 2014\npeppa pig 2014\n===============================\npeppa pig \npeppa pig hd\npeppa pig cartoon\npeppa pig full episode\npeppa pig english episodes\ncartoon",
